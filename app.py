Exercise 2: Print the sum of the current number and the previous number
Write a program to iterate the first 10 numbers, and in each iteration, print the sum of the current and previous number.

    
print('Printing current and previous number sum in a range(10)')
previous_number = 0
for i in range(10):
    current_number = i
    sum = current_number + previous_number
    print(f'Previous number: {previous_number}, Current number: {current_number}, Sum: {sum}')
    previous_number = i
