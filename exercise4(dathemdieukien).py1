Exercise 4: Remove first n characters from a string

Write a program to remove characters from a string starting from zero up to n and return a new string.

For example:

    remove_chars("pynative", 4) so output must be tive. Here, we need to remove the first four characters from a string.
    remove_chars("pynative", 2) so output must be native. Here, we need to remove the first two characters from a string.

Note: n must be less than the length of the string.


def remove_characters(word, n):
    x = word[n:]
    if n < len(word):
        return(x)
    else:
        print("n must be less than the length of the string")
result = remove_characters("HenryPham", 7)
print(result)
